## 1. User Experience (UX)

Unregistered users can see the cars, profiles, comments and biddings. but can't place a post(car), comment or bid.

Registered users can create, read, update and delete their posts(cars), commments and biddings. They can follow their favorite sellers and only see their posts(cars) in feed. They can also save the posts(cars) which they interested in and find it easy later. The users can also edit their profile, username and password.
